# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I plan to evaluate a few years of NYT crossword puzzle grids. I will exclude Sunday puzzles because they are 21x21 rather than 15x15 like all other days of the week.
My hope is to use this information to investigate some of the following questions:

On average, how many black squares are there in the puzzle? Does this correlate to which day of the week the puzzle is for?
Which squares are most likely to be black squares on a given day? in general?
I hope to make an interactive 'heat map' of where the black squares tend to be.

An extention of this idea would be to generate template crossword grids using the data collected from answering the previous questions.


## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I plan to work by myself.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Are there particular python libraries that I should learn about that would help with web scraping?
I have started to look into beautiful soup. Is that a good one?
