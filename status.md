Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I can successfully have the user input what day of the week the puzzles should be evaulated for and how many should be evaluated.
I can handle rectangular nonstandard size puzzles and produce a 2D array with percents for each square on the board.
I have the beginnings of the displaying heatmap as a choropleth grid.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I still need to add user interactivity with the display.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I had to overcome the issue of nonstandard board size.
