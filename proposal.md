It will allow a puzzle creater to place and/or produce a sample grid for where non-letter squares should go. It will indicate how many black squares have been placed and generate clue numbers. It will allow the puzzle creator to type letters into the grid. The user will be able to use the mouse or arrow keys to interact with the puzzle's grid.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

In addition to the above, allow the user to choose which squares to black out and produce an approximate level of difficulty based on how many black squares were placed.

In addition to the above, allow the user to enter letters into the grid and introduce the arrow keys as an option to navigate around the puzzle grid.
